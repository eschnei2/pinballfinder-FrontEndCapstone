The purpose of this app is to crowdsource a list of what pinball machines are in what arcades.

This is a React App.

To run this app you will need run this with an npm start, as well start a json server in port 8088. so that means in js.node use 

npm start in the root of this folder
json-server -p 8088 -w database.json -------in the root of the json server.

This app can run without any dummy data, feel free to reach out to me if you'd like the JSON data.

This does use google Embed API. So if you want that functionality you'll have to get your own.

This uses material UI for all styling.  For the most part this works well for XXL screens to xxs screens.
